# Parameters
P=3				# Number of UPC processes to run
INPUT=test		# Path to your input file

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

# Run program
aprun -n 1 ./serial ${INPUT}
upcrun -n $P -shared-heap=1G ./pgen ${INPUT}

# Sort contigs in both output files to compare
sort serial.out > serial.sorted
sort pgen.out > pgen.sorted

# diff -q <file1> <file2> will print nothing if both files are equal
# It will say "Files <file1> and <file2> differ" otherwise.
# Hint: remove -q option to show the lines that differ (not recommended when your output file is large)
